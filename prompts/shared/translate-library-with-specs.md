Translate the **entire** C library in c_src/ to Rust. The Rust cdylib must
export the **complete public ABI** of the C library and produce **byte-identical
output** for the same inputs. Write Cargo.toml and src/ files in the current
directory (NOT in c_src/).

SCOPE — read before you start:
- The WHOLE library in c_src/ is under test, not a subset. The C build globs
  ALL of c_src/ into one shared library; you must reproduce every public symbol
  it exports. Do NOT pick "the interesting" or "the most likely-tested" module
  and translate only that — translating a self-contained corner and verifying it
  perfectly is NOT a success; it is a failed translation of the library.
- First, enumerate the full surface: build the C library, run `nm -D` on the
  resulting C `.so`, and list EVERY exported public symbol (also scan the public
  headers). That list is your definition of done. A large library (dozens of
  files, hundreds of symbols) is expected — cover all of it.

This is a LIBRARY. Requirements:
- Cargo.toml must have crate-type = ["cdylib"] under [lib]
- All public C functions must use #[unsafe(no_mangle)] and extern "C"
- Pay attention to C preprocessor macros that RENAME functions (e.g.,
  `#define foo NAMESPACE(foo)` makes the linker symbol `PREFIX_foo`, not `foo`).
  The Rust #[no_mangle] name must match the FINAL linker symbol, not the
  source-level name. Check header files for namespace macros.
- Preserve the exact C function signatures (use *const c_char, c_int, etc. from std::ffi)
- Do NOT fix bugs in the original C code — if the C has incorrect behavior, reproduce it exactly
- Preserve the exact order of error checks and validation
- Use safe Rust internally where possible

Some C functions may have CBMC (`__CPROVER_`) specifications that describe their behavior. Requirements:
- The implementation of the translated Rust code should be faithful to the specifications.
- Do NOT translate the specifications themselves, only use them to guide your translation of the
  function.
- Some specifications may be bounded to enable a verifier to terminate in a reasonable amount of time;
  if you have to make a choice between capturing the C function's behavior accurately or adhering to
  the bounded specification, you should aim to capture the function's behavior accurately and leave
  a comment explaining your choice.

Run 'cargo build --release' and fix any errors until it compiles.
Do NOT modify anything in c_src/.

COMPLETION GATE — you are NOT done when the crate merely compiles. You are done
only when `nm -D` on your Rust `.so` exports EVERY public symbol that `nm -D`
on the C `.so` exports (same names, including macro-generated ones). Diff the
two symbol lists; for every C export still missing from Rust, translate the
source that defines it and repeat. A crate that compiles but exports only a
fraction of the C symbols is incomplete — keep going until the diff is empty.
