Translate the C code in c_src/ to Rust that produces **byte-identical output** for the same inputs.
Write Cargo.toml and src/ files in the current directory (NOT in c_src/).

This is a LIBRARY. Requirements:
- Cargo.toml must have crate-type = ["cdylib"] under [lib]
- All public C functions must use #[unsafe(no_mangle)] and extern "C"
- Pay attention to C preprocessor macros that RENAME functions (e.g.,
  `#define foo NAMESPACE(foo)` makes the linker symbol `PREFIX_foo`, not `foo`).
  The Rust #[no_mangle] name must match the FINAL linker symbol, not the
  source-level name. Check header files for namespace macros.
- Preserve the exact C function signatures (use *const c_char, c_int, etc. from std::ffi)
- Do NOT fix bugs in the original C code — if the C has incorrect behavior, reproduce it exactly
- Preserve the exact order of error checks and validation
- Use safe Rust internally where possible

Some C functions may have CBMC (`__CPROVER_`) specifications that describe their behavior. Requirements:
- The implementation of the translated Rust code should be faithful to the specifications.
- Do NOT translate the specifications themselves, only use them to guide your translation of the
  function.
- Some specifications may be bounded to enable a verifier to terminate in a reasonable amount of time;
  if you have to make a choice between capturing the C function's behavior accurately or adhering to
  the bounded specification, you should aim to capture the function's behavior accurately and leave
  a comment explaining your choice.

Run 'cargo build --release' and fix any errors until it compiles.
Do NOT modify anything in c_src/.
