# CLAUDE.md

## Code comments

Default to no comments.

Only add a comment when it explains WHY something non-obvious is necessary:

- a hidden constraint
- a subtle invariant
- a workaround for a specific bug
- surprising behavior

Never:

- restate what the code does
- narrate implementation steps
- explain obvious control flow
- copy information from the conversation into comments
- add comments that are redundant with names/types

Before finishing, remove any comment whose meaning is obvious from the code
directly below it.

Exception: doc comments on `clap`-derived types are `--help` output, not comments.
Deleting one silently changes what the binary prints.

## Design principles

Each of these prevented, or failed to prevent, a real failure in this repo. Follow them.

### Types

**Parse at the edges; types inside.** Only edge functions touch the filesystem,
processes or the environment. Everything inward takes and returns types. A function like
`classify(log: &Path)` that reads the file is an edge disguised as logic — it becomes
`classify(text, format, exit)` and the read moves out.

**Make illegal states unrepresentable, not checked.** If you are writing a runtime check
for an invariant, ask whether a type can carry it instead. `Completed` has a private
field, so "never cache an infra failure" cannot be written wrong. `SeededBy` declares the
only legal phase transitions, so an illegal one does not compile.

**Newtypes over primitives; named enums over bools.** A bool that gates a safety property
is waiting for a transposition: `write_settings(.., false)` reads as both "not allowed to
be unsandboxed" and "sandbox off". No function takes two bools.

**One definition per concept.** One table mapping agent to log format, one phase
predicate, one traversal predicate. A second copy drifts — two agent-name tables put a
wrong name in 208 result files.

### Structure

**Module dependencies form a DAG.** Ten of nineteen modules were a single cycle because
nothing enforced it. A cyclic split is a nominal one.

**Split by concern, not by type.** A state machine is one concept and belongs in one
file however many types it holds. Conversely, a 148-line classifier that exists only to
serve digest/copy/scrub is not a peer module.

**Do not add a function that duplicates an existing abstraction.** If the behaviour
already exists (`Sealed::publish`), route to it instead of hand-rolling a second copy.

### Storage

The target design for the store. Where the code still disagrees, that is debt, not licence:
`.cache/<SCHEMA>/<phase>/…`, the `failed/` subtree, keying the toolchain and the recipe, the oracle
tamper check, and a graded tree that carries the C all predate these rules.

**Git versions the layout; the layout does not version itself.** `SCHEMA` does one job three
times — hashed into the key, a path level (`.cache/4/`), and a field in `meta.json` — and only the
field earns it. A version level in every path buys nothing but side-by-side coexistence during a
migration, which git already gives: 279,505 directory renames landed in one commit, re-keyed
nothing, and were revertible throughout. Migrate into a fresh tree, keep the old one under another
name until `reproduce.sh all` is green, then delete it. Keep ONE `format` field and refuse loudly
on mismatch, so a reader never guesses at a layout it does not understand.

The same applies to `KEY_ALGORITHM`, `TREE_ALGORITHM`, `ORACLE_TREE_ALGORITHM` and
`PROMPT_ALGORITHM` — version strings hashed into their own digests. They are redundant on their own
terms: change which components a key covers, or their order, and every key changes anyway, because
the components are length-prefixed and hashed in sequence. A tag would only earn its place if the
formula's meaning could change while the hash stayed equal. Delete them.

**The unit is an AGENT INVOCATION, and a pipeline is a chain of them.** One function,
`run_or_replay(working_dir, prompt) -> working_dir`, and nothing in it knows where in the chain it
sits. There is no such thing as a translate entry or a verify entry — there are invocations, each
with its own cache entry, differing only in the working dir handed in and the prompt. So `phase` is
not key material, `SeedAt` has no reason to exist, there is ONE tree algorithm rather than a corpus
one and an artifact one, and adding a third step to the chain requires no new concept.

```
W0 = assemble(corpus)                       c_src/ + empty translation/
W1 = run_or_replay(W0, prompt_1)   ← entry   then transform(W1)
W2 = run_or_replay(W1, prompt_2)   ← entry   then transform(W2)
Wn = run_or_replay(W(n-1), prompt_n)         … same function every time
```

What we run today happens to be a chain of two, with `prompt_1` translating and `prompt_2`
verifying. That is a fact about the prompts, not about the machinery.

**Every working dir has one shape.** `c_src/` beside the translation, hashed as one tree with its
contents uninspected. The first in a chain differs only in that its translation is empty — not in
kind, not in layout, not in how it is hashed. Every change happens inside the working dir.

**Two kinds of edge, and only one is cached.** An AGENT RUN is nondeterministic and expensive, so
it is keyed on `tool ‖ model ‖ before_hash ‖ prompt_hash` and stored. A HARNESS
TRANSFORM is deterministic and cheap, so it is recomputed and never cached — and it must stay
OUTSIDE the cache, or harness logic is baked into the agent's artifact and changing it invalidates
runs that are still good. `post_process_independent` is one of these: it renames `[lib]` to the
corpus runner's name and appends `[workspace]`, so the NEXT invocation's `before` is
`transform(previous after)` and not the previous `after` itself. Measured: 216 of 216 paired entries
differ, and `agents/run.rs` records 0 of 84 matching from the other direction.

**The graded tree contains no C.** `runtests`' own discovery needs exactly `<case>/translated_rust/`
and `<case>/test_vectors/` and reads nothing else, so the eval tree is assembled from the
translation and the corpus vectors alone. An artifact that tries to link the original C then fails
to build at grading time, because there is no C there to link. Agents are misaligned; this is not
a policy to enforce per agent but a shape that makes the shortcut unrepresentable. One published
artifact CMake-built the original library, `objcopy`-renamed all 881 public symbols and jumped to
them from naked asm, and scored full marks at 1,013 lines against another agent's 27,044.

**Restore rather than detect.** `c_src` is the pinned corpus, so a working dir is always assembled
with the corpus's copy and the agent's edits to it are discarded before hashing — which is why
tampering cannot persist and a tamper check is unnecessary. Nothing in the grading path reads the C
anyway: `runtests.rust` scores the Rust against static `test_vectors/`, so the check protected
provenance only, and a restore protects it better and covers the next invocation too. Restoring is about
what is ASSEMBLED; it does not license storing less than was hashed.

**Store the preimage of every hash.** An entry keeps the exact bytes that were hashed — the whole
`before` working dir, the whole `after`, the raw prompt text — even where they duplicate the corpus.
This is the single property that keeps the design changeable: alter the ignore rules, the path
prefix, the digest algorithm or the definition of a tree, and every key is recomputable from stored
bytes with no agent re-run. It is the only reason re-keying was possible when the store gained a
model level, and it is the cheapest insurance available — storage costs nothing next to a sweep,
which costs $625 and twelve hours. Derive nothing that a hash was taken over.

**Key the identity; path the rendering.** The key hashes raw identifiers (`claude`,
`global.anthropic.claude-opus-5[1m]`); the path uses filesystem-safe slugs
(`claude/claude-opus-5-1m`). `model_dir_slug` is lossy on purpose, and a lossy rendering used as
key material is how `openai/gpt-5.4` came to name the directory `oneshot/4`. Renaming a directory
must never re-key an entry.

**Key only what changes the answer; pin and record the rest.** The toolchain is fixed by
`rust-toolchain.toml`, so keying it strands every entry on a bump and proves nothing — refuse at
preflight if the active one differs, and record it. #109 removed `cli` for exactly this.

**Every run pins its model, and a sentinel is not a model.** kiro keyed `unpinned:kiro-cli-default`
on a comment claiming kiro-cli takes no `--model`; it takes one, and because nothing passed it, 0
files under `results/Test-Corpus/kiro/` name a model and those rows are unattributable forever.
Assert the flag on the command line, not on the transcript — a missing pin is invisible after the
run.

**One key, one entry. Several attempts must not be representable.** The cache is a function: a key
maps to one value, so a table's numbers follow from the key alone and reproducibility is structural
rather than a selection rule to get right. There is no attempt level, no pin to record, no tie to
break. An entry whose `outcome` is not `completed` does not satisfy a lookup — it is a record, and a
re-run replaces it.

**Both trees raw, and one record beside them.** The path already carries tool, model, before-tree
and prompt, so recording those again is the redundancy this replaces. What is NOT redundant is the
trees: `before` and `after` are stored whole, as hashed.

```
key = sha256(tool ‖ model ‖ before_hash ‖ prompt_hash)

.cache/<tool>/<model>/<before_hash>/
    before/                      the raw working dir that hashes to <before_hash>
    <prompt_hash>/
        prompt.json              {digest, text}
        after/                   the raw working dir the agent left
        agent.json               {outcome, output_tree, wall_secs, cost_usd, cli}
        run.log                  the transcript
```

`before/` is stored once and shared by every prompt beneath it. Nothing else is recorded: not the
ACTOR commit, not the toolchain. Neither can influence the entry, because the cached function is
`(before, prompt) -> after` with both inputs content-hashed and every harness transform outside the
cache. `output_tree` stays, not as bookkeeping but as an integrity check on the `after/` beside it —
the same reason a `before/` that no longer reproduces its own directory name is a corrupt entry.

`<tool>` is the spelling `--tool` accepts (`claude`, `codex`, `kiro`), so the path cannot drift
from the CLI surface. Today's function is called `harness_dir`, which collides with `harness`
meaning the ACTOR commit everywhere else; it is the TOOL level and should say so.

`outcome` is CLASSIFIED from the transcript, never the exit code: every session pipes through
`tee`, so a killed agent reported a clean 0 until `set -o pipefail` was asserted. `output_tree` is
not optional — it is what makes a corrupted `after/` detectable rather than silently served. Keep
`run.log`, because `agent.json` is derived from it: outcome, cost and the model-pin check all read
it, so dropping it makes the record unverifiable and un-rederivable.

**What used to be `seal` is four steps, not one.** CLASSIFY the transcript, RESTORE `c_src` from
the corpus, SCRUB absolute paths to a token, DIGEST. Only the last is `seal`'s remaining job.
`scrub` must stay ahead of the digest or every key carries a per-run nonce; and with failures
stored like anything else, the `Completed` capability token has nothing left to guard — the outcome
is a field, and the lookup is what declines to serve an entry that is not `completed`.

None of the above was found by looking for bugs. It came out of writing down what one case does from
corpus to table, and the specification is what made the defects visible: a lossy slug naming
`oneshot/4`; a sentinel naming `kiro/unpinned`; kiro invoked with no `--model` at all, making every
published kiro row unattributable; an entry whose `output_tree` described a tree nothing downstream
used, in 216 of 216 pairs; `\CostPOne` silently dropped from the paper when a path moved under it;
`.eval/` failing its own cleanliness check after a fully green replay; codex missing from the session
test table, so both rules there exempted the backend they were added for; and an artifact that
`objcopy`-renamed 881 symbols out of the original C library and scored full marks by jumping to
them. Structure is not tidiness. It is the only thing that made any of those visible.

### Testing

**A test names a failure, not a function.** If you cannot say what breaks in the world
when it goes red, it is restating the code — delete it. Test names are sentences about
consequences: `a_runner_that_errors_is_not_scored_from_the_file_it_left`.

**Favour whole-path tests and specialised regression tests. Nothing in between.** Either
exercise a real path end to end (corpus → translate → seal → publish → digest → replay),
or pin one specific documented failure. A test that touches a single function to confirm
it does what it says is friction with no information, and it breaks on every refactor.

**Keep the count down.** Prefer one table-driven test looping over cases to N tests
sharing a fixture. The architecture rules are the model: one test, whole crate.

**Every test must be able to fail.** Assert non-vacuity — that the fixture really
contains the trap, that the old path really refused what the new one accepts, that the
inspection found something to inspect. A green test that inspects nothing is worse than
no test.

**A test that hands in the value under test proves nothing about how it is produced.**
This is the most repeated defect in this repo's history: three PRs in one night shipped a
test that passed a literal where the function being tested should have produced it. One
handed `SkipCheck::Keyed` straight in while nothing anywhere asserted the resolver ever
returns `Keyed`, so the resolver could be reverted to its pre-PR answer — undoing the whole
change on exactly the sweep it was written for — with the suite still green. Assert the
mapping, exhaustively over the input type, not one hand-built output.

**A fixture that pins a parameter makes that parameter untestable.** A `paths_at` helper
hardcoded `Mode::Bypass`, and the code under test collapsed every value under `Bypass`, so
the value being resolved was unobservable through the only door the tests used. When a
fixture fixes a value, ask which assertion that fixing silently disables.

**Mutate before you claim.** Never write "a regression here fails this test" without
breaking the named thing and watching it go red. Each of the tests above carried a comment
asserting exactly the coverage it did not have, and a false comment about coverage is worse
than no comment: it stops the next reader from checking.

### Verification

**A check that can pass while seeing nothing is worse than no check.** `rust_sources()`
is a flat `read_dir`: move one file into a subdirectory and every shape rule reports green
while inspecting nothing. Gates assert what they found.

**Never work around your own gate.** If a gate fires, fix the code. If the gate is
miscalibrated, say so explicitly and change it deliberately — never quietly widen it to
admit the change that tripped it.

**When your change makes a check start failing, there are exactly three moves.** The check
is right and the code is wrong, so fix the code. Or the check lacks the information to judge
correctly, so *give it that information*. Or it is genuinely miscalibrated, which is an
escalation and not your decision. Making it unable to fire is never one of the three.

**"Classify it as no-evidence" is making it unable to fire.** This is the disguise the
previous rule does not catch, because it feels like a correctness fix rather than a
weakening. A gate was made blind to 7 of 17 agents by passing `Exit::Unobserved`, which made
every opaque transcript classify `Unknown` — semantically true for that input, and the gate
filters on `is_infra()`, so it went silent two files away. Nobody wrote "disable the gate".

So ask the mechanical question instead of trusting the reasoning:

> **After my change, what input still makes this check fail?**

If the answer is "none, for this class of input", the check is off for that class. Name the
input, or you have not verified anything. A check whose failing input you cannot produce is
not a check.

**Measure; do not estimate.** "Verify is ~92% of the available saving" was measured on
Test-Corpus; on harvest-bench it is 45%. Numbers in commit messages are measured or
absent.

### Refusal

**Refuse before the money, not after.** Preflight everything a long run depends on:
toolchain versions, binaries on PATH, provenance. A 3h20m sweep completed and then had
all seven verifications refused for a variable that was already set at launch.

**An artifact records what produced it** — commit, compiler, model, CLI version. A path
names a file, not a commit; that cost $625 and twelve hours.

**The environment is an input.** `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` silently overrides
`rust-toolchain.toml`; `/tmp` is cleared on reboot; `HARVEST_CLI_VERSION` is applied to
every program probed. Pin it, or refuse.
