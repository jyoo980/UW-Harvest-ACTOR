//! The agent-invocation cache: one key, one entry, and the path IS the key.
//!
//! `.cache/<tool>/<model>/<before>/<prompt>/` carries every component the key is made of, so there
//! is no key hash to keep in agreement with the directory it names. That only holds if every level
//! is INJECTIVE, which is why [`model_dir`] encodes rather than abbreviates: the previous rendering
//! stripped a vendor prefix as everything-before-the-first-dot and turned `openai/gpt-5.4` into a
//! directory called `4`.
//!
//! One entry per key. Several attempts are not representable, so a table's numbers follow from the
//! key alone and there is no selection rule, no recorded pin and no tie to break.
